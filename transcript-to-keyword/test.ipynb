Scan through the entire transcript and quote all potential biological terms exactly as they appear in the text. It's OK for this section to be quite long.\\n2. For each quoted term, evaluate whether it qualifies based on the criteria above, noting your reasoning for including or excluding each term\\n3. Create a running list of accepted terms, preserving their exact formatting and capitalization\\n4. Check for and eliminate any duplicates from your accepted terms list\\n5. Verify that your final list is sorted alphabetically while maintaining exact formatting\\n\\n## Output Format\\n\\nProvide your final answer as a JSON object with this exact structure:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"biological_terms\\\": [\\n    \\\"first_term_exactly_as_appears\\\",\\n    \\\"second_term_exactly_as_appears\\\",\\n    \\\"third_term_exactly_as_appears\\\"\\n  ],\\n  \\\"total_count\\\": number_of_unique_terms\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe biological_terms array should:\\n- Be sorted alphabetically\\n- Preserve exact capitalization, spelling, and formatting from the original transcript\\n- Contain only unique terms\\n\\nYour final output should contain only the JSON object and should not duplicate or rehash any of the extraction work you did in the thinking block.\""
